# Database_SQLalchemy and FastAPI

## Project Description
This project is a **simple Python script** that automatically opens your calendar when you start your PC. The motivation behind this project is straightforward: **to ensure you never miss out on planning your day**. Starting your day with an overview of your schedule helps you stay organized and productive.
Also, I have recently started using reclaim.ai along with google calendar, so I have listed these 2 main sites. Feel free to change and add your own custom websites.

The script is converted into an executable file using **Auto Py to Exe** and is set to run at startup using **Windows Task Scheduler**.
